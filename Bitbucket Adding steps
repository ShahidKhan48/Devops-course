1. Step 1: Install Git in VS Code/intellijeidea
2.Step 2: Create a Repository on Bitbucket
Login to Bitbucket and create a new repository.

Click on Create repository.
Set your repository name (e.g., my-vscode-project).
Choose repository visibility (private or public).
Choose Git as the repository type.
Click on Create repository.
Once the repository is created, you will be provided with the repository URL. Copy that, as youâ€™ll need it later.

Step 3: Configure SSH for Bitbucket (Optional but Recommended)
To connect VS Code and Bitbucket securely, it's best to use SSH.

Generate SSH Key: Open a terminal (or Git Bash) and generate an SSH key:-
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "md7481920@gmail.com"
